📈 Google Stock Price Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) 📈
Welcome to the Google Stock Price Prediction project! In this project, we use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict stock prices, aiming to capture trends in Google’s historical stock price data.

🌟 Project Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the sequential and volatile nature of financial data. This project implements a deep learning model with RNN and LSTM layers, which are effective for time-series forecasting due to their ability to retain information across long sequences. The model was trained on historical stock price data, achieving promising results in predicting future trends.

📂 Project Structure

🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Data Loading: Load historical Google stock price data.
Feature Scaling: Scale prices between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler.
Data Structuring: Create sequences of 60 timesteps (one output per sequence) for training.
Reshaping: Reshape data to fit the RNN’s expected input shape (batch size, timesteps, features).
2. Model Building
Constructed an RNN using the following layers:
4 LSTM Layers: Each with 50 units and dropout regularization.
Output Layer: Dense layer with 1 unit for final price prediction.
Compilation: Used Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function.
3. Model Training
Trained the model over 100 epochs with a batch size of 32.
4. Prediction & Visualization
Loaded test data, generated predictions, and scaled results back to original values.
Plotted the actual vs. predicted stock prices to evaluate model performance.
📊 Results
The model demonstrated a close approximation to Google’s actual stock prices, indicating that LSTMs effectively captured temporal dependencies in the data. While not perfect (due to the unpredictable nature of financial data), the model shows a strong ability to follow trends.

🛠 Future Improvements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust model hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
Additional Features: Include other technical indicators (moving averages, etc.) to enrich the dataset.
Alternative Models: Experiment with more complex architectures or ensemble methods.
